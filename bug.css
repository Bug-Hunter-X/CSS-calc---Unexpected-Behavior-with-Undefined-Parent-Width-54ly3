The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not produce the expected result if the parent element doesn't have a defined width. This is because `calc()` calculates based on the parent's width, and if it's not explicitly set, it defaults to auto, and the calculation will not behave as expected.
